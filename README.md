# project-caesar
welcome retards, this is a culmination of something i've been working on for the past day, i know the name is different but lemme just show you how all this is done.

step 1: download SC.
step 2: make sure you have ollama and python (maybe even docker).
step 3: once you completed the download of the main requirements, install requirements.txt for python repository.
step 4: activate the VENV for better running 
step 5: ollama serve, or open the goddamn ollama server.
step 6: watch as you become irrelevant, or improve upon the things it lacks (such as speed).
